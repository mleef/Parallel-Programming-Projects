\chapter*{Executive Summary}
The Office of Strategic National Alien Planning (OSNAP) has made a substantial investment in a Ballistic Defense System (BDS). As part of the acquisition, control software is required to drive the ground stations. In realtime, AKWDS will select targets and take action to destroy detected threats.

AKWDS utilizes the existing Flying Object Sensor Array (FOSA) to identify the location of various friendly, hostile, and unknown objects in the defended airspace. From the FOSA data stream, AKWDS will estimate object trajectories and prioritize targets. AKWDS will stream computed heading, azimuth, and muzzle velocity to BDS. The connection between FOSA, AKWDS, and BDS has some latency and BDS cannons require moderate time between firings; so AKWDS must make predictions from the FOSA observations rather than target the detect object directly.
