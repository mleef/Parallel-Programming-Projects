This directory contains a latex template for the term project that you are free to use.

For your term project we want to understand what your team is going to produce, what you expect the highlevel architecture to look like, and how parallelism will be involved. We are also interested in a motivation for the program and a timeline that your team plans to work to. You will notice that there is a section for each in the template.

Program Motivation -> Executive Summary
What you will produce -> Project Description
Highlevel Architecture -> Highlevel Architecture
Parallelism Involved -> Parallel Plan
Timeline -> Project Schedule

To build:
pdflatex proposal.tex
