\chapter*{Project Description}
Anti-Kinetic Weapon Defense System (AKWDS) is the control software solution to integrate Flying Object Sensor Array (FOSA) and Ballistic Defense System (BDS). In some respects, the project can be thought of much like an automated Missle Command, Artillery, or Worms game. FOSA displays the data in a machine readable format. AKWDS houses the AI that makes decisions from the data. BDS actions the AKWDS firing command. FOSA and BDS for this project are backed by a basic physics simulation. We also plan to have FOSA output go to a 3D visualization in realtime or as a post-hoc analysis.

Simulation is planned to have 1 second between clock ticks. AKWDS processing time will be handled as a constant amount of delay or by rounding up the wall clock time to the nearest second. We simulate 1 second of delay between FOSA and AKWDS. 30 seconds of delay is simulated between AKWDS and BDS (simulating the time to move the firing mechanism). 60 seconds must elapse between shots.

We will write the n-body simulator, which will produce the FOSA stream and consume the BDS stream. We will also write AKWDS, which will consume the FOSA stream and produce a BDS stream. The simulator and AKWDS will live in separate process spaces and will be connected via TCP or MPI or some other IPC mechanism. We also plan to provide a 3D visualization using some visualization technology which may be online or posthoc (OpenGL, pov-ray, JavaFX, blender, VisIt, ???).
